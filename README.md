# Word-Guessing-Game
Hello! This was my very first mini-project in High-School.
A simple rendition of a word-guessing game with a scores management system.

The game is coded on Python using basic libraries such as time and random. The management of scores- including creation, updation and deletion- was coded using MySQL.
This project was created as a connection between Python and SQL Database.
